## Cacti templates

These templates were developed under 1.2.2, but exported after an upgrade to 1.2.14, so it might be that you need to tweak the XMLs a bit when trying to import them into an older version.

I exported all templates separately, so that you can easily decide, which of them you would like to use in your environment.
